#Jupyter_Notebook
I used Jupyter Notebook in grad school for a lot of projects. It made it very easy to share code with my instructors, and be able to isolate sections for testing. Since I have continued to use it for testing testing blocks of code or data analytics. At the time of me publishing this you could install Anaconda which includes Juptyer Notebooks from the following link: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
